      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Kyle Damschen, an enthusiastic recent graduate with a
        Computer Science degree, eager to embark on a journey in the world of
        software engineering. My passion for technology and problem-solving has
        driven me to pursue a career where I can transform innovative ideas into
        functional, user-centric software solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I am working with the Citrus Clonal Protection Program at UC
        Riverside, where I am taking advantage of technology to enhance lab
        teams performance and their experiance. I have also worked with ACM@UCR
        as a software developer, where I have been able to work on a variety of
        projects and gain valuable experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, working out, and
        spending time with my friends and family.
      </p>
